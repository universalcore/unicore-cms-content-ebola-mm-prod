The Department of Social Welfare is the focal agency for disability and it has increased its attention including the support to victims of landmines and ERW.\r\n \r\nThe services includes wide ranges: For examples, emergency medical services, physical rehabilitation, psychosocial counselling, livelihood and etc.\r\nBut we need clear mapping of who is providing what and where?  The communities need to know where to go and who to call if there is such incidents. I think this is one of the key agenda of the MR working group planned for 2015-2016. \r\n",
